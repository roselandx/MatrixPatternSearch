Couple notes for this project, I have options like use frameworks as Apache matrix, math etc and recursive pattern finding etc, however I decide build the core algorithm, like transposing the matrix to enhance method usability, check indexable points to define matching path etc as I understand lower level like embedded coding will help performance and troubleshooting in future. This project could easily converted into maven , spring , swing, etc as pom file generated as well as unit testing.
